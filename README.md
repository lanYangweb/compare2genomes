In this study, I randomly selected 50 genes from the sequence files (FASTA) and gene annotation files (GTF) of human chromosome 1 and the Lactobacillus genome, extracted their sequences and translated them. 

I found that there was not a significant difference in GC content between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes (43.08% vs. 36.44%), although eukaryotic genes were much longer than prokaryotic genes, there was not such a significant difference in protein-coding length. 

Furthermore, by analyzing the translation level of gene DNA sequences, I found that there was a huge difference between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, which is closelyrelated to the structure of eukaryotic genes.
